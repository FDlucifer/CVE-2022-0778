# CVE-2022-0778

The discovered vulnerability triggers an infinite loop in the function `BN_mod_sqrt()` of OpenSSL while parsing an X.509 certificate.

This happens because the `p` parameter is supposed to be prime, but it is not checked inside the function, and most importantly nowhere in the stack of calls while parsing the certificate.

## How to test

The prerequisite is having installed `gcc` and a vulnerable version of OpenSSL.

Compile with `gcc -o my_bad_sqrt my_bad_sqrt.c -lcrypto`, run `./my_bad_sqrt` and watch it hang forever! :D

## Hitting the loop

The function `BN_mod_sqrt()` implements the [Tonelli-Shanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonelli%E2%80%93Shanks_algorithm) algorithm for finding a modular square root, i.e. given an integer `a` and a prime number `p`, returns a value `r` such that `r^2 == a (mod p)`.

Analyzing the [commit](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/9eafb53614bf65797db25f467946e735e1b43dc9) that patches the vulnerability we see that the culprit is the loop that finds the least index `i` for which `b^(2^i)==1 (mod p)`, where `b` is defined before in the algorithm.

The loop is changed from

```C
i = 1;
if (!BN_mod_sqr(t, b, p, ctx))
    goto end;
while (!BN_is_one(t)) {
    i++;
    if (i == e) {
        ERR_raise(ERR_LIB_BN, BN_R_NOT_A_SQUARE);
        goto end;
    }
    if (!BN_mod_mul(t, t, t, p, ctx))
        goto end;
}
```

to

```C
for (i = 1; i < e; i++) {
    if (i == 1) {
        if (!BN_mod_sqr(t, b, p, ctx))
            goto end;
    } else {
        if (!BN_mod_mul(t, t, t, p, ctx))
            goto end;
    }
    if (BN_is_one(t))
        break;
}
```

In the second case, there is a for loop limited by the variable `e`; in the original code however there is only a check for the case `i==e` inside a while loop.

Since these loops are inside a bigger loop that for each iteration sets the new value of `e` to the current value of `i`, we try the following attack strategy:
1. in the first execution of the outer loop, make so that `i=1` at the end; for this, we need that `b^2=1 (mod p)`.
2. in this way, during the second execution we will have `e=1`, and if we can get into the inner loop the `i==e` check will always fail
3. if we manage to always have `t != 1 (mod p)`, we will then stay in the loop forever

Notice that the first two steps can actually happen in a "normal" execution, i.e. with a prime `p`. However, if `p` is composite we can also satisfy the third step!

### Some maths

The Tonelli-Shanks algorithm works by writing `p - 1 = 2^e * q`, with an odd `q`. This is also the order of the multiplicative group of integers modulo `p`, and the values `e` and `q` will be used many times during the execution; however, if `p` is not prime, the order of the multiplicative group will not be `p-1`, and this will help us to get into the infinite loop.

In particular, `b` is initialized as `b = a^q (mod p)`, meaning that if `p` was prime, then `b` would have order some power of `2`, which we will then find using the loop.

But if we set `p = r * s`, the order of the multiplicative group is `(r-1)*(s-1) = r*s - r - s + 1` instead of `r*s-1`. The algorithm uses the `q` value to obtain an element `y` of order exactly `2^e`; however, when `p` is not prime, the `q` value will not have a special meaning for the order, so the element `y` will not have order a power of two modulo `p=r*s`.

Since at the end of the first outer loop `b` is set to `b = b*y^(e-i) (mod p)`, at its second iteration the inner loop will try to find a value `i` for which `b^(2^i) == 1 (mod p)`, but will fail given that `y` is no more guaranteed to have order a power of two.

### The exploit

The numbers in the exploit are very simple: we take `r=17,s=41`, which give `p=r*s=697`. This means that the computed values of `e` and `q` will be `p-1 = 2^5 * 87`.

We then pick `a=696`, which means that `a == -1 (mod p)` and also `b == -1 (mod p)` when initialized. This will satisfy step 1 setting `e=1` for the following outer loop.

Then `b` will be set to an element with order not a power of `2`, and the inner loop will be stuck trying to find and `i` for which `b^(2^i)==1 (mod p)`.
